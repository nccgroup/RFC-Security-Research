This would allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS), and potentially execute arbitrary code on the device.
CVE-2019-14310,CWE-787,Ricoh SP C250DN 1.05 devices allow denial of service (issue 2 of 3). Unauthenticated crafted packets to the IPP service will cause a vulnerable device to crash. A memory corruption has been identified in the way of how the embedded device parsed the IPP packets
CVE-2019-6327,CWE-120,HP Color LaserJet Pro M280-M281 Multifunction Printer series (before v. 20190419), HP LaserJet Pro MFP M28-M31 Printer series (before v. 20190426) may have an IPP Parser potentially vulnerable to Buffer Overflow.
CVE-2005-2526,CWE-189,CUPS in Mac OS X 10.3.9 and 10.4.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending a partial IPP request and closing the connection.
CVE-2000-0510,CWE-20,CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) 1.04 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a malformed IPP request.
CVE-2008-0597,CWE-399,Use-after-free vulnerability in CUPS before 1.1.22, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted IPP packets.
CVE-2008-1446,CWE-189,Integer overflow in the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) ISAPI extension in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 through 7.0 on Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP1 and SP2, and Server 2008 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via an HTTP POST request that triggers an outbound IPP connection from a web server to a machine operated by the attacker, aka \"Integer Overflow in IPP Service Vulnerability.\"
CVE-2017-15400,CWE-93,Insufficient restriction of IPP filters in CUPS in Google Chrome OS prior to 62.0.3202.74 allowed a remote attacker to execute a command with the same privileges as the cups daemon via a crafted PPD file, aka a printer zeroconfig CRLF issue.
CVE-2017-18190,CWE-290,A localhost.localdomain whitelist entry in valid_host() in scheduler/client.c in CUPS before 2.2.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary IPP commands by sending POST requests to the CUPS daemon in conjunction with DNS rebinding. The localhost.localdomain name is often resolved via a DNS server (neither the OS nor the web browser is responsible for ensuring that localhost.localdomain is 127.0.0.1).
CVE-2004-0558,CWE-399,The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) implementation in CUPS before 1.1.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (service hang) via a certain UDP packet to the IPP port.
CVE-2007-4351,CWE-189,Off-by-one error in the ippReadIO function in cups/ipp.c in CUPS 1.3.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted (1) textWithLanguage or (2) nameWithLanguage Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) tag, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
CVE-2009-0949,CWE-399,The ippReadIO function in cups/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.10 does not properly initialize memory for IPP request packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a scheduler request with two consecutive IPP_TAG_UNSUPPORTED tags.
CVE-2014-2707,CWE-78,cups-browsed in cups-filters 1.0.41 before 1.0.51 allows remote IPP printers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the (1) model or (2) PDL, related to \"System V interface scripts generated for queues.\"
CVE-2014-4336,CWE-77,The generate_local_queue function in utils/cups-browsed.c in cups-browsed in cups-filters before 1.0.53 allows remote IPP printers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the host name.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2707.
CVE-2010-2941,CWE-399,ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS 1.4.4 and earlier does not properly allocate memory for attribute values with invalid string data types, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted IPP request.
CVE-2003-0195,CWE-119,CUPS before 1.1.19 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a partial printing request to the IPP port (631), which does not time out.
CVE-2003-0788,CWE-134,Unknown vulnerability in the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) implementation in CUPS before 1.1.19 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption from a \"busy loop\") via certain inputs to the IPP port (TCP 631).
